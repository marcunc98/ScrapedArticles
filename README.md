# ScrapedArticles

# FriendFinder

The goal with this assignment was to create an application utilizing Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news article headings, links, and summary data into your app and display them on the front end. As well, the goal was to allow users to have the ability to interact with the app by commenting on specific articles and saving those comments/notes to a specific article.

Navigation:

- A web link via the localhost port(localhost:7000) or heroku should take you to the home page of the app. 
Heroku link  - 
GitHub link - https://github.com/marcunc98/ScrapedArticles

- You should be able to simply select either the "scrape new article, clear article, save article, or delete article buttons and they should function appropriately. As well, the app should allow for comments to be created and saved to specific article that has been scraped.
